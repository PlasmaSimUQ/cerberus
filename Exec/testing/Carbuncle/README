Carbuncle.inputs:
A rectangular domain with normal shock processing a randomly perturbed fluid. 
Showcases numerical instability of the shock solver. Suppression is performed 
by using a hybrid HLLE/HLLC Riemann flux solver with an appropriately chosen 
shock detection threshold (~100).

Cheese.inputs:
The affectionately named cheese-grater effect develops during the course of 
an isotope RMI with relatively small plasma length scale.
