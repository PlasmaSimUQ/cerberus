The process for preparing an SVG is as follows:
1) Draw your SVG image, probably in Inkscape
2) Draw a circle and centre it at your origin and set its ID to 'origin' [right-click->Object Properties->ID]. This will ensure that your imported geometry is where it should be relative to the origin defined in the inputs file.
3) Set the units of the SVG to whatever is desired [File->Document Properties or Shift+Ctrl+D, then set Display units] this will determine the imported dimensions in the simulation. For example, if the image is a 1x1 box (in whatever units) then in the simulation the geometry will be a 1x1 box also.
